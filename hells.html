          	<h1>Buddhist Hells</h1>
          	<p class="history">In the Buddhist tradition there are many different hells that one can be reborn into as punishment for negative karma accrued over past lives. Among these hells in the hell realm, there are 8 hot hells and 8 cold hells, as well as varying accounts of other neighboring hells depending on the source (Lopez 2016). The picture of the hell realms above portrays these 16 common hells in the bottom left and right, and the pictures show the punishments in each hell in a similar fashion to how the chains of causation were portrayed on the Wheel of Life. The 8 hot hells include punishments like “scorching heat while being pierced by tridents,” “being eaten by animals,” and “being crushed by big hot things” (O’Brien 2020). There are less descriptions of the 8 cold hells, but they include punishments such as “shivering and moaning,” “freezing while the blisters break open,” and “being so frozen the body falls apart” (O’Brien 2020). The tortures in these hells can last for up to millions of years in order to work off the negative karma that one had to have to be reborn into the hell realm (Lopez 2016). In addition to simply accruing negative karma, there are five acts a Buddhist could commit that would ensure a rebirth into one of the torturous hot hells. These five unforgivable deeds are “killing one’s father, killing one’s mother, killing an arhat , wounding the Buddha, and causing dissension in the community of monks and nuns” (Lopez 2016).</p>
