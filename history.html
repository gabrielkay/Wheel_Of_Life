          	<h1>History of the Bhavacakra</h1>
          	<p class="history">The Bhavacakra (translated to English as “Wheel of Life”) is a type of painting found on the porches of many monasteries representing some of the core tenets of the Buddhist religion. The paintings are intended to help teach laypeople about the beliefs of Buddhism and give them a roadmap of how to convert to Buddhism and break free from the cycle of rebirth (Teiser 2004, 73-74). The paintings are also intended to be accompanied by a preacher who can readily explain the imagery and symbolism for each part of the wheel (Rinpoche 2019). However, when simply viewing an image of a Bhavacakra online it is hard to figure out the symbolic meanings of each image, thus the reason this site was created: to provide context for the meaning of each segment of the Bhavacakra through interactive annotations.</p>
			<p class="history">The Bhavacakra has been an important piece of art in the Buddhist tradition since the very early days of the religion. There are surviving Bhavacakras in India dating back to the 5th century AD and written records of the tradition of creating these paintings dating all the way back to around 200 AD (Teiser 2004, 73-74). The origin story of the Bhavacakra is that after seeing his disciple Maudgalyayana converting crowds of people to Buddhism from his public preaching of the dharma, the Buddha laid out instructions for a painting of the dharma that can be painted outside monasteries in order to teach passersby in a similar fashion to Maudgalyayana’s sermons (Teiser 2004, 74).</p>
			<p class="history">Not all Bhavacakra look alike, but there are certain attributes that remain constant between most depictions of the wheel of life. In the origin story of the Bhavacakra, the Buddha dictated that these paintings should portray the three poisons, the different realms, the 12 members of the chain of causation, and Yama holding the wheel (Thomas 1901, 2). While Bhavacakra share these common elements, they vary in the ways in which they visually portray each element. For example, some wheels combine the god and demi-god realms into one realm, and many differ in their portrayals of links in the chain of causation. In the Bhavacakra on this site, monkeys are used to portray the links of consciousness and attachment on the chain of causation, but other Bhavacakra use humans and monkeys interchangeably in these portrayals (Sunapati Thangka School). The Bhavacakra included in this site is fairly standard, but by looking around the internet for other examples you’ll surely find some interesting differences in how artists visually depict the Buddhist dharma.</p>
