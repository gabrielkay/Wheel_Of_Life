				<div class="sections realms">Six Realms</div>
				<div class="sections nidanas">Twelve NidƒÅnas</div>
				

				<div class="tooltip1 snake">The Three Poisons
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						The three poisons are greed (rooster), snake (ill will), and pig (delusion). They are the three sources of all evil that generate harmful karma and keep humans trapped in the cycle of Samsara. They are displayed intertwined, reinforcing each other.
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 karma1">Positive Karma
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						This section represents positive karma. It shows people reaping the benefits of good karma and moving towards higher states of spiritual enlightenment.
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 karma2">Negative Karma
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						This portion shows the results of negative karma. Here we see malformed humans, as well as a bull. The bull in Buddhism symbolizes rebirth, showing that bad karma will lead to rebirth and a continuation of the cycle of Samsara.
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 realm1">God Realm
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						Life in the God realm is long and pleasurable. It takes a lot of good karma to be reborn here, but after a pleasurable rebirth in the God realm with no suffering, one inevitably uses up their good karma and will be reborn into a lower realm.
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 realm2">Demi-God Realm
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						The Demi-God realm is portrayed here at war with themselves as well as the God realm. Demi-Gods are less powerful than Gods and more powerful than humans, but suffer from greed, envy, and amorality. They covet the fruit from the tree of immortality which is rooted in the Demi-God realm but the fruits lie above in the God realm. The Demi-Gods are portrayed attacking the God realm out of jealousy for their spoils.
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 realm3">Human Realm
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						Humans are portrayed doing everyday tasks such as herding and farming. The human realm is the most desirable realm to be reborn into, as it is the most balanced realm between pleasures of the God realms and the suffering found in the lower realms. These conditions allow humans to best practice the dharma, accumulate karma, and potentially achieve enlightenment.
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 realm4">Animal Realm
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						This section shows a variety of animals one could be reborn as. Rebirth in the animal realm entails suffering through animal experiences like being hunted, worked in the fields, and slaughtered. It's hard to accumulate good karma in the animal realm, so beings are often reincarnated thousands of times in a row as animals working off their bad karma.
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 realm5">Hungry Ghost Realm
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						The hungry ghosts are shown here emaciated with thin necks. These beings are paying for their greed and misdeeds in previous lives by living in a state of constant hunger and thirst. Hungry ghosts live right below the realm of humans which allows them to see humans but not be seen by humans, which leads the hungry ghosts to suffer further from isolation and despair.
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 realm6">Hell Realm
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						In the hell realm we see beings burning, drowning, being boiled, and more. Here is where those who commit evil actions are punished for up to 60,000 years before suffering through accumulated bad karma and being reborn into a higher realm. <a href="hells.html">Click here to learn more about the 18 hell realms.</a>
