				<div class="tooltip1 buddha">Buddha
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						The Buddha is outside of the wheel of life because he has escaped the cycle of rebirth. He is pointing at Yama to teach his followers the truth about the wheel of life (BBC)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 yama">Yama
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						Yama is the Monster of Impermanence. He holds the wheel of life that traps all beings in the cycle of suffering (BBC)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 l1">Ignorance
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						Here a blind man is used to portray ignorance. His blindness is a metaphor for spiritual blindness, where he can not see the truth about the path to enlightenment (BBC)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 l2">Willed Action
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						A potter making pots represents the deeds and actions we perform in our lives. We are responsible for shaping our lives just as a potter shapes his pots (Wheel of Life)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 l3">Consciousness
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						The monkey grabbing the fruit in the tree is a symbol for the curiousity and short attention span that humans have with our conciousness (Teiser 2008, 141)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 l4">Name and Form
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						The boat represents our reality carrying two passengers: name and form. Name represents our non-physical qualities while form represents our physical bodies, and they are both seperate parts of our reality, just as the two men are seperate passengers on the boat (Lochtefeld 2005)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 l5">Six Senses
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						Here a house with six windows is used to represent the 6 senses (sight, sound, smell, taste, touch, and mind). The six senses allow information to pass into our realities just as windows let light enter a house (BBC)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 l6">Contact
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						A man and woman making love are used to show the result of sensual perception in that it brings humans in contact with the world around them (Wheel of Life)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 l7">Feeling
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						A man with an arrow stuck in his eye shows the how contact can lead to feeling. The arrow is this man's wounds from emotions (Lochtefeld 2005)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 l8">Craving
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						The man enjoying himself in this picnic scene is falling into his cravings for food and drink (BBC)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 l9">Grasping
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						The monkey reaching for the fruit is grasping for something to satisfy a craving (in this case for food) (Lochtefeld 2005)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 l10">Becoming
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						When one is so engrossed by their cravings that they start to grasp for things to satisfy them, they are fully immersed in the worldly experience and are once again trapped in the cycle of suffering, hence the pregnant woman preparing to give birth (BBC)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 l11">Birth
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						This woman giving birth is bringing a a baby into the world who will continue the karmic cycle of rebirth (Wheel of Life)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 l12">Death
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						Here a wrapped corpse is shown on its way to a burial mound. Old age, illness, death, and grief are the consequences of human existence, and will all lead back to the state of ignorance in the first link (Teiser 2008, 141)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 karma2">Negative Karma
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						This portion shows the results of negative karma. Here we see a bull and two malformed naked humans moving downwards. This shows how negative karma leads one down to rebirth in the lower realms (Holmes)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 karma1">Positive Karma
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						This section represents positive karma. It shows people reaping the benefits of good karma and moving towards higher states of spiritual enlightenment (Holmes)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 snake">The Three Poisions
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						The three poisons are greed (rooster), snake (ill will), and pig (delusion). They are the three sources of all evil that generate harmful karma and keep humans trapped in the cycle of Samsara. They are displayed intertwined, reinforcing each other (Teiser 2004, 73)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 realm1">God Realm
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						Life in the God realm is long and pleasurable. It takes a lot of good karma to be reborn here, but after a pleasurable rebirth in the God realm with no suffering, one inevitably uses up their good karma and will be reborn into a lower realm (Lochtefeld 2005)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 realm2">Demi-God Realm
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						The Demi-God realm is portrayed here at war with themselves as well as the God realm. Demi-Gods are less powerful than Gods and more powerful than humans, but suffer from greed, envy, and amorality. They covet the fruit from the tree of immortality which is rooted in the Demi-God realm but the fruits lie above in the God realm. The Demi-Gods are portrayed attacking the God realm out of jealousy for their spoils (Teiser 2008, 140)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 realm3">Human Realm
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						Humans are portrayed doing everyday tasks such as herding and farming. The human realm is the most desirable realm to be reborn into, as it is the most balanced realm between pleasures of the God realms and the suffering found in the lower realms. These conditions allow humans to best practice the dharma, accumulate karma, and potentially achieve enlightenment (BBC)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 realm4">Animal Realm
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						This section shows a variety of animals one could be reborn as. Rebirth in the animal realm entails suffering through animal experiences like being hunted, worked in the fields, and slaughtered. It's hard to accumulate good karma in the animal realm, so beings are often reincarnated thousands of times in a row as animals working off their bad karma (Lochtefeld 2005)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 realm5">Hungry Ghost Realm
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						The hungry ghosts are shown here emaciated with thin necks. These beings are paying for their greed and misdeeds in previous lives by living in a state of constant hunger and thirst. Hungry ghosts live right below the realm of humans which allows them to see humans but not be seen by humans, which leads the hungry ghosts to suffer further from isolation and despair (Lochtefeld 2005)
					</span>
				</div>

				<div class="tooltip1 realm6">Hell Realm
					<span class="tooltiptext">
						In the hell realm we see beings burning, drowning, being boiled, and more. Here is where those who commit evil actions are punished for up to 60,000 years before suffering through accumulated bad karma and being reborn into a higher realm (Teiser 2006, 7) <a href="hells.html">Click here to learn more about the different hells in the hell realm</a>
